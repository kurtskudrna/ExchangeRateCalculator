## Exchange Rate Calculator
This Project is a Calculator that will take a certain amount of one currency and automatically convert it to the amount it would be in the other currency.
## Motivation
I thought this would be a cool project and would help me get a start building projects with APIs(api.exchangerate-api.com).
